            <!-- <img src="http://via.placeholder.com/895x552.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Blog image" /> -->
            <div class="blog-excerpt open-sans-font pb-5">
              <p>RESTful APIs play a major role in modern web applications, especially when working with web, mobile, or third-party services. As a backend-focused Laravel developer, I primarily work on designing and developing APIs that are scalable, secure, and easy to maintain.</p>
              <p>Laravel provides a clean and powerful structure that makes API development efficient. With built-in features like routing, middleware, validation, and authentication, it becomes easier to manage complex backend logic.</p>
              <p>While building RESTful APIs, I focus on proper request validation, consistent response structures, and secure authentication methods such as token-based access. This approach ensures that APIs remain reliable and easy to consume by frontend applications like React or mobile apps.</p>
              <p>also work extensively with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to design optimized schemas and write efficient queries that improve application performance.</p>
              <p>In real-world projects, APIs often need to communicate with third-party services. I have experience integrating payment gateways like PayPal, Stripe, and Revolut, as well as AI-powered APIs for tasks such as result generation, nutrition calculation, and image background removal.</p>
              <p>By following clean code practices and backend-first architecture, I aim to build APIs that support long-term scalability, smooth integrations, and real business needs.</p>
